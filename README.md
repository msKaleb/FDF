# FDF

42Cursus-fdf/42Urduliz

## Key Features
This project uses trigonometric transformations to place 3dimensional vertices (with XYZ coordinates) into a 2d screen space, using differents algorithms
(like Bresenham algorithm to draw the lines between two points, or linear gradient to change smoothly from one color to another)

## Examples

## How To Use
